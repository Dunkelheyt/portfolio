      <p>Here you can see all the games I have previously worked on.
In addition to the translation or localization, I do run tests to check the quality of the script and the compatibility with the target audience (Latin America).</p>
      <p>Also, I do <i><b>Linguistic Quality Assurance (LQA)</b></i> to check if there are any grammatical errors, bugs, or if something needs a change.
In addition to the gameâ€™s script translation/localization, I do provide translations for the following items:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Promotional materials</li>
      <li>Storefront descriptions</li>
      <li>Webpages and manuals</li>
      </ul>
        <div className="row">
          {
          					data.Translations.map((translation) => {
          						return (
